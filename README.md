# CPSC-4070

Repository for assignments and final project for Clemson's CPSC 4070: Applied Computer Vision with Professor Huang 

Each assignment covers a separate topic in Computer Vision, including but not limited to: Image Filtering and Object Recognition.

The final project is designed as a product defect recognition software built to combine multiple traditional algorithms of object recognition with modern deep learning algorithms for object recognition to ensure the highest level of accuracy possible, sacrificing some computing costs in the process to ensure accuracy on product manufacturing lines.
